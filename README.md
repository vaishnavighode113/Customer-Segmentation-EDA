# Customer-Segementation-EDA

## Project Overview
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer segmentation data to identify key patterns and trends. Customers were segmented into meaningful groups such as Champions, Loyal Customers, and At-Risk Customers. The insights derived help businesses design targeted retention strategies and streamline sales efforts across multiple countries.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- Power BI

## Project Files
- .ipynb file: Contains complete EDA process, analysis, and segmentation logic
- Power BI file: Interactive dashboard for post-EDA visualization

## Key Outcomes
- Identified customer purchasing behavior patterns
- Performed RFM-based segmentation
- Generated actionable insights to improve customer retention
- Enabled data-driven decision-making for sales optimization
